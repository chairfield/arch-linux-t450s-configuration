I installed the 32-bit libs, useful for Skype, Steam, and Wine

I installed pulseaudio-ctl to enable the keyboard keys, and it created a config here:
~/.config/pulseaudio-ctl/config
- I can get a little libnotify graphic by uncommenting a line in here

- Used xev to find that my F4 is XF86AudioMicMute
- Installed alsa-utils to get alsamixer to manually unmute
- My audio card is source 1, not 0; fixed
