wicd works consistently, and even doesn't require that I suspend the iwlwifi module during hibernate
connman consistently failed after hibernate, even with suspending iwlwifi and iwlmvm

Method for connecting in a new place:
1. start wicd.service and run wicd-gtk
2. scan to find name of wireless (bssid not necessary at least if no key required)
3. update wpa_supplicant.conf
4. reboot

TODO: learn to scan without wicd
TODO: does restarting wpa_supplicant.service avoid reboot?
