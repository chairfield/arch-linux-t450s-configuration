1. Must blacklist bluetooth
2. With wicd, no need to blacklist iwlwifi
3. Must suspend thinkpad_acpi module during hibernate
    http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thinkpad-acpi#Hibernate
    SUSPEND_MODULES stored in /etc/pm/config.d/modules

Arch Linux package ships with support for the following backends: kernel, tuxonice, and uswsusp

Needed to switch to linux-lts as my screen stayed black occassionally on thaw with standard kernel
    I know it's also possible to use video quirks in pm-utils, but I know nothing about them

linux-lts didn't work; I got a black screen with an unchanging cursor on thaw (why did it thaw when I ran pm-suspend-hibernate?)
    Next step: try another backend (tuxonice, probably)

Switch back from pm-utils to systemctl hibernate per:
    https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1423442
Relevant:
    "I will consider the thread as solved with this lesson:
     - Don't use pm-utils
     - Use systemctl hibernate
     And:
     - Don't update libsystemd, systemd or linux and than hibernate (or the other way around)."

# Strategy:
# - suspend on lid close
# - Only hibernate when I have no open/active tasks
# - Hope hibernate works with linux-ice
# - Wait at least until the weekend to add any additional hibernate-related features
