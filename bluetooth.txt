I'm getting the following systemd errors:

Note that I'm getting the following pulseaudio errors right after the bluetooth ones:
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: bind(): Address already in use
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Failed to load module "module-native-protocol-unix" (argument: 
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Module load failed.
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Failed to initialize daemon.

Suggestions from:
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=195886
- FAILED: Install pulseaudio-bluetooth
- FAILED: Check rfkill list

Clue:
rfkill list shows two Bluetooth devices (hci0 and tpacpi_bluetooth_sw)

Attempt:
- Disabling acpid.service
    - Result: it halved the number of bluetooth errors
- Disabling bluetooth.service (removed dbus-org.bluez.service as well)
    - Result: removed the other half
        Going to try 10 hibernates

NOTABLE: 10 successful hibernates with both acpid.service and bluetooth.service disabled
