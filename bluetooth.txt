I'm getting the following systemd errors:

Note that I'm getting the following pulseaudio errors right after the bluetooth ones:
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: bind(): Address already in use
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Failed to load module "module-native-protocol-unix" (argument: 
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Module load failed.
Oct 24 12:30:46 ARCHER pulseaudio[2916]: Failed to initialize daemon.

Suggestions from:
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=195886
- FAILED: Install pulseaudio-bluetooth
- FAILED: Check rfkill list

Clue:
rfkill list shows two Bluetooth devices (hci0 and tpacpi_bluetooth_sw)

Attempt:
- Disabling acpid.service
    - Result: it halved the number of bluetooth errors
- Disabling bluetooth.service (removed dbus-org.bluez.service as well)
    - Result: removed the other half
        Going to try 10 hibernates

NOTABLE: 10 successful hibernates with both acpid.service and bluetooth.service disabled

Failed to come out of hibernate next morning
    Noticed the following errors:
        Nov 02 10:05:30 ARCHER kernel: Bluetooth: hci0 sending Intel patch command (0xfc8e) failed (-19)
        Nov 02 10:05:32 ARCHER kernel: Bluetooth: hci0 command 0xfc8e tx timeout
        Nov 02 10:05:32 ARCHER kernel: Bluetooth: hci0 sending frame failed (-19)
        Nov 02 10:05:34 ARCHER kernel: Bluetooth: hci0 command 0xfc11 tx timeout
        Nov 02 10:05:40 ARCHER kernel: Bluetooth: hci0 exiting Intel manufacturer mode failed (-110)

Ideas:
- Disabled in BIOS?
- Why is it soft-blocked?
- Uninstall all bluetooth modules temporarily?
    Removed pulseaudio-bluetooth, bluez, bluez-libs, and bluez-utils

Didn't work! Still encountering the above errors on reboot

Going to try unblocking bluetooth with a systemd service a la: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=154338
    Have to reinstall the above packages to get hciconfig

Still failed to thaw with those bluetooth errors on force-restart.
    Attempting to disable the bluetooth kernel module: install bluetooth /bin/false in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bluetooth.conf
